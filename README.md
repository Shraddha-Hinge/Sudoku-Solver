## Introduction

The Sudoku Solver is designed to take a partially filled Sudoku grid and solve it using backtracking. It serves as an educational tool for understanding recursive algorithms and their application in solving constraint satisfaction problems.

## Components

### Custom Classes

- **SudokuGrid**: Represents the 9x9 Sudoku grid. It includes methods for setting and getting cell values, checking for valid moves, and printing the grid.
- **SudokuSolver**: Implements the backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It interacts with the `SudokuGrid` class to perform operations on the grid.

### Solver Algorithm

- **Backtracking**: The solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to try different possibilities in each cell of the grid, backtracking when a conflict is detected until the puzzle is solved.

### User Interface

- The user interface is command-line based, allowing users to input a Sudoku puzzle, run the solver, and display the solved grid.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Compile the project using the provided Makefile with the `make` command.
5. Run the executable `sudokusolver.out` to start the application.
6. Input your Sudoku puzzle through the command-line interface.
7. The program will output the solved Sudoku grid if a solution exists.
